## Pre-Implementation Requirements

Before writing ANY code, complete these steps:

### 1. User Flow Documentation

- Map complete user journey from start to finish
- Identify all user touchpoints and interactions
- Document expected inputs and outputs
- Define success and failure scenarios
- Validate flow with stakeholders

### 2. Technical Requirements Analysis

- List all technical components needed
- Identify data storage requirements
- Define API endpoints and interfaces
- Specify security and authentication needs
- Document performance requirements

### 3. Dependency Mapping

- Identify all external dependencies
- Map integration points with existing systems
- Check version compatibility
- Assess impact on current architecture
- Plan for dependency management

### 4. Implementation Planning

- Break down into specific tasks
- Estimate effort and complexity
- Identify potential blockers
- Plan testing strategy
- Define acceptance criteria

## Scoping Framework

### Clear Boundaries

- **IN SCOPE**: Specific features and functionality
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: What will NOT be included
- **FUTURE SCOPE**: Planned for later releases
- **ASSUMPTIONS**: What we're assuming to be true

### Success Criteria

- Functional requirements met
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- Security standards compliance
- User experience goals satisfied
- Technical debt minimized

### Risk Assessment

- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Timeline risks and contingencies
- Resource risks and alternatives
- Integration risks and fallbacks
- User adoption risks and solutions

## Documentation Requirements

- Feature specification document
- Technical design document
- API documentation
- User guide or tutorial
- Testing strategy document

## Approval Gates

- [ ] Requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Technical approach validated
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmed
- [ ] Timeline realistic and approved
- [ ] Success metrics established
- [ ] Risk mitigation planned

## Implementation Readiness

Only proceed to implementation when:

- Full feature flow is documented
- Multiple approaches have been considered
- Clear implementation plan exists
- All dependencies are identified
- Testing strategy is defined

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Starting to code without full understanding
- Unclear or expanding scope during development
- Missing critical dependencies
- Inadequate planning for edge cases
- No clear definition of "done"
