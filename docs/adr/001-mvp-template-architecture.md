# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

**ADR Number:** 001  
**Date:** 2025-01-04  
**Status:** Accepted

## Title
MVP Template Repository: Multi-Architecture Quick-Start System with AI Task Management

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to create a template repository that can rapidly transform Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into fully-configured, development-ready environments for MVP creation. The solution must support multiple tech stacks, integrate AI-powered task management, and provide a clean handoff to development teams.

- **Business Context**: Accelerate MVP development from weeks to hours by providing pre-configured environments
- **Technical Context**: Support 30+ architectures across frontend, backend, mobile, and serverless platforms
- **User Context**: Enable both technical and non-technical stakeholders to set up production-ready development environments

## Decision Drivers
- **Speed**: Reduce MVP setup time from days/weeks to minutes
- **Flexibility**: Support diverse tech stacks and architecture combinations
- **Quality**: Ensure production-ready configurations with best practices
- **AI Integration**: Leverage AI for task generation and project management
- **Maintainability**: Keep template system updatable and extensible
- **Developer Experience**: Provide clear workflows and comprehensive documentation

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Single Monolithic Template
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple to maintain
  - Consistent structure
- **Cons**: 
  - Limited flexibility
  - Bloated with unused dependencies
  - Difficult to customize
- **Trade-offs**: Simplicity vs flexibility

### Option 2: Multiple Separate Repositories
- **Pros**: 
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Focused templates
- **Cons**: 
  - Maintenance overhead
  - Difficult discovery
  - No shared infrastructure
- **Trade-offs**: Organization vs maintenance burden

### Option 3: Dynamic Multi-Architecture Generator (Chosen)
- **Pros**: 
  - Single repository with multiple outputs
  - Shared rule system from awesome-cursor-rules
  - AI-powered task management integration
  - Clean archival system for unused files
- **Cons**: 
  - Complex setup logic
  - Requires rule mapping maintenance
- **Trade-offs**: Flexibility and power vs initial complexity

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option: Dynamic Multi-Architecture Generator

**Rationale**: This approach provides maximum flexibility while maintaining a single source of truth. The integration with awesome-cursor-rules provides battle-tested development rules, while Taskmaster AI enables intelligent task management from PRDs.

### Positive Consequences
- Supports 30+ architectures from a single template
- Automatic rule selection and configuration
- AI-powered task generation from PRDs
- Clean project handoff with archived template files
- Easy extension with new architectures
- Comprehensive development workflows

### Negative Consequences
- More complex initial setup logic
- Requires maintenance of rule mappings
- Dependency on external awesome-cursor-rules repository
- Learning curve for template maintainers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] Create architectures.json with 30+ architecture definitions
- [x] Implement rule mapping system to awesome-cursor-rules
- [x] Build Python and Node.js quick-start scripts

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ✅
- [x] Add popular tech stacks (MERN, T3, Django+React, etc.)
- [x] Implement environment variable generation per architecture
- [x] Create archival system for template cleanup
- [x] Add project configuration tracking (.mvp-config.json)

### Phase 3: AI Integration & Workflows ✅
- [x] Integrate Taskmaster AI for task management
- [x] Create comprehensive MVP setup workflow
- [x] Build task context template system
- [x] Add helper scripts for common operations

## Success Metrics
- **Setup Time**: < 5 minutes from template to development-ready
- **Architecture Coverage**: 30+ supported architectures
- **Rule Integration**: 100+ cursor rules automatically configured
- **Task Generation**: PRD → 15-25 actionable tasks
- **Developer Experience**: Single command setup with clear next steps

## Validation & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Template Usage**: GitHub template creation metrics
- **Setup Success Rate**: Percentage of successful quick-start completions
- **Community Contributions**: New architecture additions and rule updates

### Monitoring Strategy
- **GitHub Analytics**: Template usage and fork statistics
- **User Feedback**: Issues and discussions for improvement areas
- **Dependency Health**: Monitor awesome-cursor-rules integration

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| awesome-cursor-rules breaks/changes | High | Medium | Fork and maintain stable version, implement fallback |
| Taskmaster AI unavailable | Medium | Low | Graceful fallback, manual task creation guide |
| Architecture mapping maintenance | Medium | High | Community contributions, automated testing |
| Template complexity | Low | Medium | Comprehensive documentation, example workflows |

## Future Considerations

### When to Revisit This Decision
- When awesome-cursor-rules significantly changes structure
- If Taskmaster AI integration becomes unreliable
- When we exceed 50+ architectures (complexity threshold)
- If user feedback indicates setup is too complex

### Evolution Path
- **Short-term** (3-6 months): Add more popular tech stacks, improve error handling
- **Medium-term** (6-12 months): Visual setup interface, cloud deployment integration
- **Long-term** (12+ months): IDE plugin, automated dependency updates
