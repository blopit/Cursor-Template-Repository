# Scoped Conversations

## Core Rules
- Keep conversations small and focused
- One feature/issue per conversation
- Clear scope boundaries
- Explicit change restrictions

## Best Practices
- Start new chat for each issue
- State "Fix X only" explicitly
- Avoid scope creep
- Document decisions made

## Implementation Guidelines
- Define clear goals upfront
- List files to be modified
- Specify what NOT to change
- Review changes for scope adherence

## Conversation Structure
1. State specific issue/feature
2. Define scope boundaries
3. List allowed changes
4. Document decisions
5. Verify changes stay in scope
