# File Tagging and Header Log Rule

## Overview
- Every file created or edited by an AI model must:
  - Be tagged with the model name (e.g., gpt-4-turbo, anthropic-claude, etc.)
  - Include a header log with the date/time (from the session start) and the model name

## Requirements
- **Tagging:**
  - Add a comment at the top of the file indicating the model that created it.
    - Example (Python): `# Created by: gpt-4-turbo`
    - Example (JS): `// Created by: gpt-4-turbo`
    - Example (Markdown): `<!-- Created by: gpt-4-turbo -->`
    - Example (JSON): `// Created by: gpt-4-turbo`
    - Example (Shell): `# Created by: gpt-4-turbo`
    - Example (MDC): `# Created by: gpt-4-turbo`
- **Header Log:**
  - Add a log line with the date/time and model name at the top of the file, updated on every model edit.
    - Example (Python): `# Last edited: 2024-06-22 14:30:00 UTC by gpt-4-turbo`
    - Example (Markdown): `<!-- Last edited: 2024-06-22 14:30:00 UTC by gpt-4-turbo -->`
- **Format:**
  - Use the appropriate comment style for the file type.
  - Always place the tag and log at the very top of the file.
  - The date/time must be generated by calling the date function at the start of the session (do not guess the time).
- **On Edit:**
  - Update the "Last edited" log with the new date/time and model name on every model edit.
