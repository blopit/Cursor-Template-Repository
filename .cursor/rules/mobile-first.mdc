# Mobile-First Frontend Development

## Core Principles
- Design for mobile devices first
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Touch-friendly interfaces (44px+ touch targets)
- Readable typography (16px+ on mobile)

## Implementation
- Start with mobile styles (no media queries)
- Use min-width media queries for larger screens
- Stack form fields vertically on mobile
- Test on 320px to 1920px+ screens
