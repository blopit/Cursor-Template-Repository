description: Always use MVP tag for Taskmaster operations, never human tag
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true

# Taskmaster Tag Usage Rule

## Core Requirement
- **ALWAYS use the "MVP" tag** when working with Taskmaster operations
- **NEVER use the "human" tag** - human tasks are NOT for AI agents
- Switch to MVP tag at the start of any Taskmaster session

## Implementation
- Before any Taskmaster operation, ensure you're on the MVP tag
- Use `use_tag` tool to switch to "MVP" if not already active
- All task operations (get_tasks, next_task, etc.) should work with MVP tag

## Commands Affected
- get_tasks
- next_task
- get_task
- expand_task
- add_task
- update_task
- set_task_status
- All other Taskmaster MCP tools

## Tag Switching
```
# Always start with this
mcp_taskmaster-ai_use_tag(name="MVP")
```

## Forbidden
- Never work with "human" tagged tasks
- Never assume current tag without checking
- Never mix human and MVP tasks
