# Feature Scoping Process

## Pre-Implementation Requirements
- Full feature flow documented
- Multiple approaches considered
- Clear approach selected
- Implementation plan ready

## Scoping Steps
1. Document user flow
2. List technical requirements
3. Identify dependencies
4. Plan implementation

## Implementation Boundaries
- Clear scope definition
- Explicit limitations
- Defined deliverables
- Success criteria

## Best Practices
- No scope creep
- Document decisions
- Regular scope review
- Update plans as needed

## Forbidden Practices
- Coding without plan
- Unclear boundaries
- Undocumented changes
- Scope expansion
